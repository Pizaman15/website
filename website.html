      <h1>History of VR</h1>
        <h2>Brief History</h2>
          <p> Many may believe that the idea and development of VR is quite recent, for Virtual Reality
             gaming, movie or television streaming have made Virtual Reality very popular. But VR's
             history and construction begins in the 1950's. VR's displays have become much more mainstream
             now with companies like Oculus, HTC, and others using Virtual Reality for gaming, adding a whole
             new layer to the way people play video games at their homes. The man believed to have layed the
             ground work for VR was filmaker Morton Heilig. His Sensorama was a large booth like machine
             that would fit one to four people, combining technologies for smell, sound, and vibrations,
             there was even atmospheric effects like wind that would blow in someones hair. The first actual
             head mounted display was invinted by Ivan Sutherland. The HMD was connected to a sterioscopic
             diplay connested to a computer program that dipicted simple geometric shapes.</p>
      <h2>Recent History</h2>
        <p>  The VR technologies from the 50's and 60's are not compareable to the VR technologies today. Today
             people now have wireless VR headsets and controllers, which allow for endless freedom. Tredmills
             specialy designed to hold the user and allow for imersive control over running and walking speed, and
             crouching. Graphics for VR is more than aceptable now, with 1080p resolution and Oled panels in some
             displays, giving realistic and imersive colors and visuals. VR although well known for its gaming aspect,
             VR has educational and practical uses in todays age. Schools can now afford to buy multiple machines and
             students can use them for presentations such as artwork or other graphical designs made within VR. Video
             game development studieos can use VR to create character models and other models for their games useing
             3D graphic designing. While VR's technologie has evolved exponentialy, we can expect to see much more
             in the coming years.</p>

      <h1>Effects of VR</h1>
      <h5>
        Although VR can be one of the most immursive forms of entertainment, it
        has a few minor setbacks.
      </h5>
      <h3>VR Sickness</h3>
      <p>
        VR sickness summarizes most of the negative effects after gaming with
        VR for a long amount of time. It is called VR sickness because it
        relates to an actual sickness. Most times, you take off the headset and
        you become very disoriented and dizzy. This is one of the most common
        short term effects. Another effect is nausia if you suffer from motion
        sickness.
      </p>
      <h3>Long Term Effects</h3>
      <p>
        In todays world it is unclear what long term effects may be. Most
        believe that there will be no effects in the long run so game on!
