      <h1>History of VR</h1>
        <h2>Brief History</h2>
          <p> Many may believe that the idea and development of VR is quite recent, for Virtual Reality
             gaming, movie or television streaming have made Virtual Reality very popular. But VR's
             history and construction begins in the 1950's. VR's displays have become much more mainstream
             now with companies like Oculus, HTC, and others using Virtual Reality for gaming, adding a whole
             new layer to the way people play video games at their homes. The man believed to have layed the
             ground work for VR was filmaker Morton Heilig. His Sensorama was a large booth like machine
             that would fit one to four people, combining technologies for smell, sound, and vibrations,
             there was even atmospheric effects like wind that would blow in someones hair. The first actual
             head mounted display was invinted by Ivan Sutherland. The HMD was connected to a sterioscopic
             diplay connested to a computer program that dipicted simple geometric shapes.
           </p>
      <h2>Recent History</h2>
        <p>  The VR technologies from the 50's and 60's are not compareable to the VR technologies today. Today
             people now have wireless VR headsets and controllers, which allow for endless freedom. Tredmills
             specialy designed to hold the user and allow for imersive control over running and walking speed, and
             crouching. Graphics for VR is more than aceptable now, with 1080p resolution and Oled panels in some
             displays, giving realistic and imersive colors and visuals. VR although well known for its gaming aspect,
             VR has educational and practical uses in todays age. Schools can now afford to buy multiple machines and
             students can use them for presentations such as artwork or other graphical designs made within VR. Video
             game development studieos can use VR to create character models and other models for their games useing
             3D graphic designing. While VR's technologie has evolved exponentialy, we can expect to see much more
             in the coming years.

      <h1>Effects of VR</h1>
      <h5>
        Although VR can be one of the most immursive forms of entertainment, it
        has a few minor setbacks.
      </h5>
      <h3>VR Sickness</h3>
      <p>
        VR sickness summarizes most of the negative effects after gaming with
        VR for a long amount of time. It is called VR sickness because it
        relates to an actual sickness. Most times, you take off the headset and
        you become very disoriented and dizzy. This is one of the most common
        short term effects. Another effect is nausia if you suffer from motion
        sickness.
      </p>
      <img class="pic" src="saved pictures/VRSickness.png" alt="Sick VR">
      <h3>Long Term Effects</h3>
      <p>
        In todays world it is unclear what long term effects may be. Most
        believe that there will be no effects in the long run so game on!
      </p>
           </div>
    <div id="4page">
      <h1> why VR?</h1>
        <p> People use VR to enter a world that they thought wouldnt be possible or
           have never dremt of. People want to feel the immersion of games and want to be in the center
           of the action. virtual reality tricks the brain into thinking the body
           is actually in the virtual environment. This is called 'presence' and is the true magic of VR.
           not only is VR great now and you can experience peoples imagination for the first time but VR is getting
           better every day and VR companies are making games with better immersion and better graphics.
           Who knows 20 years form now VR might be so immersive you might forget your playing
           a game.
         </p>
           <h2> Different forms of VR</h2>
           <p> you may be asking is VR just for gaming? the answer to that is no, it can also be very
             educational and teach people things that they never knew before. It might teach you
             how to build a pc or, how to play an instument and who knows, maybe it might be a
             way for teachers to teach there students in a different way 20 years
             from now. it could alos be used for buisness. it could be used for contacting many
             high end clients who dont want their identity known or maybe it could
             be used to sell your product or to advertise it.

      <h3>The best games for vr</h3>
      <p>Vr has been a bit underwhelming in terms of truly great games but now
        that enough time has passed we can finally have A truly Wonderous Catalouge,
        So without further adiou,Let's get in to some of the great games of VR
      </p>
      <h4>VRchat</h4>

        <p>Vrchat is one of the most social,memorable,and Creative experiances
          out there,and it's Free!
          (bearring the fact that you own a vr device that supports it)Vrchat is
          an interactive Dreamland of pure imagination
          Where players can create worlds and avatars by handcraftingly and
          Delicately Molding them
          To just Dumping A 3D model And give it enough rigs and things to do to
          the point where it could
          work in VR,All of this is done in unity, An engine That's essentually
          compared to a chopshop for bad dev's,Is now being used for
          Indie Dev's and studo's alike to create pretty decent games much like
          Vrchat. Games on VRchat however are mostly social based,Games like
          Werewolf,murder,deathrun,truth or dare,
          To even more complex games like Dungeons&Dragons and Escape room style games
        </p>

        <p>Vrchat is one of the most social,memorable,and Creative experiances out there,and it's Free!

          To even more complex games like Dungeons & Dragons and Escape room style games.The Avatars that the players inhabit wild just as wildly with
          the world they can go to,ranging from normal models made by the offical Dev's to, a ginat floating worm, A copy of window's 98,Some anime Gremlin,
          And even a 2D image of Phil Swift,There is always something around the corner for this game.
        </p>
            <h4>GORN</h4>
            <p>
            In the Age of Rome people would gather All across the realm to wacth one thing GLADITORIAL COMBAT.In this game you play as a Gladiator in an arena filled with other Gladiators,
            Midgets,heavily armoured people,And Giant Crabs. With GORN you can wacth as you flail your arms around Randomly hitting opponets At light speed while also
            Balencing any startigic value the battle has. Yes you heard me right this game has stratigic Value in terms of finding What peeps to go for first and keeping track of your backside.
            Combine that with the fact that the weaponry in this game is Just so weird from a normal Broadsword,Axe,And then somewhere along the line the game just says
            "No,Frick you theres Crabs now"And then you get crab arms. With an 16 ton's worth of feautre  Gorn is a game i'm sure Will stick around for a long ,long time.
          </p>
              <h4>Boneworks</h4>
            <p>Similar to GORN, Boneworks Is a physicys based VR brawler but instead of Medievil weapons and...crabs,it's Guns, spears and crowbars... and swords too but eh it's more gun focused.
              the story of the game centers Around exploing an abondonded facility owend by not appature science but by Monogon Industries With an A.I. running the joint called Myth OS

      <h1>The Future of VR</h1>
      <p> VR's future in gaming has a very promising outcome. The arcades that most people grew up with
          probably would have had an arcade racing game, claw machine, or maybe air hockey, but with new
          inovations in VR would allow for VR arcades to become much more popular. There already are a few
          select locations like Yokey Pokey in Brooklyn, you can pay $25 for 30 minutes of use of a Playstaion
          VR, Oculus, HTC Vive and Samsung gear. Usually when you think of VR gmaing, you would not expect it
          to include loctions like schools, but recently companies are making it big by educational games that
          include the use of VR. Many educators have realized that many students would learn much more efficently
          with the VR educational games than sitting in a classroom listening to a lecture. Companies such as
          zSpace are creating interactive "virtual instruction programs", which keep students engaged and
          interested.</p>
          <p>Even with the market for VR rapidly growing, challenges still arise that VR game developers
          will have to overcome. As popularity continues to grow, innovations will occur that will help push the
          future of VR gmaing in schools, arcades, and in the homes of people all around the world.</p>
