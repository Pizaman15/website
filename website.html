       <h2> why do we eat pizza?</h2>
       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean obviously we eat pizza because were usualy
         hungry but thats not true. we eat pizza becuase we want to taste the
         best food on earth. you may be asking why is it the best food on earth
         and the answer is becuase pizza can be so customizable and that is its
         best trait. lets say your in the mood for tacos but whats better than
         that? its taco pizza,or maybe you i "the mood for somthing else like
         burgers but wouldnt burger pizza be better? the answer is yes, yes it would be.

      <h1> when do people eat pizza?</h1>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you may ask yourself when is the best time to eat pizza,
         becuase you can be in the mood for it but you dont know when to eat it.
         the real answer is literally anytime you want. when your on a airplane
         or when your skydiving and even when your in the middle of scuba diving.
         i mean if u wanted to you could eat it while sleeping, because i know i do.
